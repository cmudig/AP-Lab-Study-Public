# AutoProfiler Lab Study Materials
Dataset and materials used in AutoProfiler user study.

In our user study, participants used either [AutoProfiler](https://github.com/cmudig/AutoProfiler) or [InlineProfiler](https://github.com/cmudig/ProfileInline) to perform a data cleaning and analysis task.

## Dataset
For this task, they used a housing dataset included in [dataset_housing.csv](./dataset_housing.csv). This dataset is a sample of a larger dataset of rental prices in the bay area originally from [here](https://www.katepennington.org/data) with additional errors added. Please see our paper for more details about dataset errors.

## Task
The participants were first shown a demo of the system, and then given a notebook with instructions in [AP Lab Study - Dataset 1.ipynb](./AP%20Lab%20Study%20-%20Dataset%201.ipynb) to complete the task.
